# Hello Students

Welcome to our CMPE 133 software engineering II organization on GitHub!

As you may already know, GitHub is a powerful tool that allows us to collaborate on projects, track changes, and manage code versions. Throughout this class, we will use GitHub extensively for your team project, and you will get hands-on experience with software engineering practices.

You will have access to all the repositories in our class, and you will be able to collaborate with your teammates, write and test your code, create and review pull requests, and build a strong portfolio of your software engineering projects.

We have a template repository where you can reference the README format for a standard GitHub Project and tools for managing your development progress, such as `Issues`(Epic, Story, Bug, Question), `Milestones`, `Projects`(Kanban), `Branches`, `Workflows`, etc. Check out [README.md](https://github.com/SJSU-CMPE133-2023-Spring/Software_Engineering_Sample_Repo/blob/main/README.md) and [USAGE.md](https://github.com/SJSU-CMPE133-2023-Spring/Software_Engineering_Sample_Repo/blob/main/USAGE.md) for more info.

I'm excited to work with you all and help you become proficient in software engineering practices. Don't hesitate to reach out to the TA if you have any questions or need any help throughout the class.

Let's get started and have a great semester! :D

Best regards,

Prof. Yalda and TA. Junjie
